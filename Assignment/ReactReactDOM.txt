 What is diference between React and ReactDOM
React:

Purpose: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) and managing the state of those UI components.
Functionality: It enables developers to create reusable UI components that can efficiently render and update based on changes in data or state. React uses a declarative approach where developers describe how the UI should look based on the current state, and React efficiently updates and renders the components as needed.
Key Features: Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) reconciliation, component lifecycle management, state management, and JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax are key features of React.
Example: Developers define components such as Button, Modal, or UserCard in React, which encapsulate UI logic and appearance.
ReactDOM:

Purpose: ReactDOM is a specific package in React that provides DOM-specific methods that React uses to interact with the browser's DOM.
Functionality: It facilitates the rendering of React components to the DOM and handles DOM manipulation events.
Key Responsibilities: ReactDOM renders React components into the DOM tree, manages updates to the rendered components, and ensures efficient re-rendering based on changes in state or props.
Example: ReactDOM is used to render React components into HTML elements within a web page, manage event listeners, and update the DOM efficiently.
Relationship:
Dependency: React is a dependency of ReactDOM. While React provides the core logic and functionality to define and manage components, ReactDOM provides the methods to interact with the actual DOM and display those components in a web browser.

Integration: Typically, React and ReactDOM are used together in web applications. React abstracts the UI components and their behavior, while ReactDOM handles the rendering and manipulation of these components in the browser environment.

Example code
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Example React component
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
      <p>This is a basic React component.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// Render the App component using ReactDOM
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
In this example:

React defines the App component using JSX.
ReactDOM.render() method renders the App component into the HTML element with id="root" in the DOM.
In summary, React focuses on defining UI components and managing their state, while ReactDOM handles rendering those components into the DOM and managing interactions with the browser's DOM. Together, they form a powerful combination for building interactive and efficient user interfaces in web applications.
