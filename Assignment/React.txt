 Why is React known as React?

React's Responsiveness:
    React is known for its ability to quickly respond to changes in data without reloading entire pages.
    When data in a React application changes, components are automatically updated to reflect these changes.
Component-Based Architecture:
    React promotes the creation of reusable UI components.
    Developers can build encapsulated components that manage their own state, making it easier to maintain and reuse code across different parts of an application.
Ease of Use and Learning:
    React is designed to be easy to learn, particularly for developers familiar with JavaScript and HTML.
    Its component-based nature and declarative syntax simplify the process of building complex user interfaces.
    In summary, React is named for its focus on responsive data handling, component reusability, and user-friendly development practices, making it a popular choice for modern web application development.
